l'or knowledge—since by Nature we mean the hand of (lod
Himsell'.

And, ns l have before said, the Novum Organon ia the in·
strument ιο bo used for this end. lt is the means of prepnring
us lor the entry of Truth. The Intellect is tc be purified, and
lewelled‚ so that, like a polished mirror. (to use Bacon's own
simile) it may rellcct with trnth the rays of light which fall
upon it.

Nor do l know any higher praise that can bc giren ιο
Bacon than that Newton evidently hod studicd his worln
doeply, used his terms, and practically carried on the work he

And yet as a Method the Novum Organon cannot be said

gerens, as thaso against which he himself lights so mansully in
the first book. We may look into the method as a matter ol
curiosity ; but we must not endeavour. l think, to accept or to
apply it.

What then? Is the use of the Novum Organon thus ιο be
nnrrowed in its limits? And is it worth our whilc ιο spond
labour on it, if it is bnt a matter of curiosity, and lias evena
tendency ιο lead ns astray? These are questions which na-
turally suggest themselves, and deserwe consideration.

ln the first place, l need not repeat mysels as to the intrin-
sic worth of much of the Novum Organon. No one who has
studied the work with any attention can fail to recognise this.
Evory sentence, in a great part ol the book, is pregnant with
suggestions and thoughts which will richly repa)r us for the
lnbour exponded on it. Secondly, there is enough difficulty in
the manner in which the book is put together to malie it, on
