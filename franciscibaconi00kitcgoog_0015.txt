these forth into the world was, apparently, to prepare mcn’s
minds'for the great work, whose object and character were so
unlike what was ordinarily taught in those days, that he
deemed it necessary not to produce it too suddenly or boldly.
As it was, the Novum Organon was not well received at the
first. The king made a joke on it, as jokes were then wont to
be made, rather witty and very profane; sir E. Coke made
bad rhymes against it 3 even sir T. Bodley censured it ; people
generally seemed to suppose it was something to admire, some-
thing very deep; and in an awkward way they tried to ad·
mire 3-as indeed they have gone on doing till within the last
hals century. It was the fashion to acquiesce in Bacon’s
greatness, but it was anything but the custom to verify his
reputation by the study of his works. The book had at first
more honour abroad thau at home; and, as so often happens
when men’s minda are not equal to that which is set be-
fore them, the illustration of the Metho? (viz. Nov. Org. ll.

itself, and than those noble jewels of thought which lio scat-
tered thiekly over the surfaec of the earlier portion of the
work. The discussion of the Form of Heat was reprinted
separately; and the cumbrous system of Tables thore pour-
trayed‚ together with the vague conclusions arrived at, were
held up to universal admiration. Amore intelligent respect
for Bacon is gradually taking the place of this faulty and blind
reverence3 and while men criticise the flaws in the structure
of that noble mind, they also, let us hope, give all tho more
hearty praise to the marvelloua excellenoes which it displays.
The Novum Organon was but a little fragment. In it,
indeed, are contained those principles and thoughts which
occupied Baoon’s mind all his lise through: and we cannot
be far wrong in considering the 1st book and the opening of
the and as the most important of all his philosopliical writings.
They ecmainly lift the veil which hangs over his conception of
