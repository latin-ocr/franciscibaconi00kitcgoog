expressions sor such secret movements of things; and we hare
now more knowledge ol the expression than os the thing itsell.
The other work of nature is termed semare, and is the inner
composition or arrangement of Atoms os bodies, as they are
found iu Nature. Such, sor example, as the arrangement ol
particles in crystallegraphy; or of the particles of blood, διας
the subtle laws os composition which things follow. For these
the Microsoope has proved most useful.

still remains where it was. The problem ol life and of very
being is one which scarcely admits of solution here. Thereis
a dark mist drawn across the extreme limits of our knowledge.
Form is the cause of Procees and of Structure. The crystsl

that structure is not the ultimate fact: there must he a came
