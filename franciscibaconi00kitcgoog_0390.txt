iswe take the higher view of the term Forat, his hicthod has
failed to bring us ncarer to the discovery of it.

Let me add a few worda on Modern Induction; the subject
is along one, but I will try to be brief. Its main object is thc
discovery of Laws os Nature3 and hy these Laws, taldng the
term in a wide sense, are meant those general facts which ob-
servation and experiment taach us to lay down as invariable.
Thus the Law of Gravhy, the Law oi Resraction, the Law ot'
Polarization, the Law os Actinism‚ these are ull short state-
ments of uniform facts, some more and sorno less general in
their application‚ but ali invariable in their action, so far aa we
know. From this we gather, that Modern Inducticn does not
seek for Causas, as the Ancient was said todo, but is content
to obtain those “ generalizations from experience” which form
the gronndwork of the Sciences. Os these general expressions
some are attaiuable by analysis, as many os those of Chemistry
are; others require shrewdness, sagacity, and power of invent·
ing Hypothcses‚ which may account for the Phenomena. And
it is this hitting upon the Law to answer to the isolated facts
in our possession which distinguishes Modern Induction from
Ancient3 audit is in this that the genius of modern times
peculiarly shows itself. Thus Kepler hit at last upon an Hy·
pothesis which accouutcd sor the Orbit of Mars, and the Ellip
tical Mation ci that Planet having once been ascertaiued the
Law was soon shown to be applicable to the other pianets as
welh And it was afterwards beautifully connected with the
Law of Gravity by the demonstratious of Ccntral Forces: a
tine instance os Baoon's “ quando Physicom terminatur iu
Mathematico.’'

From this it will appear that the prominent conception in
Modern Iuduction is not that of Mcthcd. ln fact, it is not at
all clear that we may use any such phrase as “the Method of
Modern Induction ;'' sor it is very doubtful whether the prosc-
cution ci Modern Scicncc ean ever be put under one law or
set os lawe. Each wisa student os Nature hae sought his in-

spiratione from her, by obscrwing hcr doiugs, and hy experi-
' ment upon thcm; by judicious selection os critical instanccs3
