rt score, excellent practice for students3 a great part ol
ose education, it should ever be rememhered, lies in obtain-

ς the power of grasping tho truths contained in books in the
st way, i. e. in the power of reading with attention and
rfit3 by no means one of the easiest parts of education. And,
rdly, though the methodos the Novum Organon is errone-
s, or, at least, inapplicable, as awhole; parts of it (us, for

I trust then that I shall be pardoned if 1 spend a little time
detailing the manner in which l believe the N ovum Organon

But the general reader will be content to give a rapid
