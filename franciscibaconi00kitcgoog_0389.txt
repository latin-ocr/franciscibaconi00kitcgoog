tlnite a variety of particulare He is more definite on the
necessity of negativos, os rejection and exclusion of all Naturae
which do not exhibit the required Nature. Passing by these
questions as very vagnely answered, if answered at all, re
eome to the doetrine of suoeessire steps, the most dhtinetire
and satisfactory part ot' Baoon's Method. For it was by print
ing out the need of discrimination between differem orden (to
spoah Mathematieally) of Generaliration, that Baeon led the
way to the construction of Modern Seienees. By sueh moeso
sire stages Astronomy, Opties, Meehanies, hare been built up
to their present noble height3 and Dr. Whewell has bosna
the palns (Phil. lnd Se. Bk. xi. eh. 6) to eonshuet apyramid
showing the gradnal progress of Astronomy. By this prom
generations hare gone on adding to tho amount of eertain
knowledge in the world; and applying the results oi Inductioo
to the amelioration of man’s lile. =

It only remaina that Ι should notiee Baoon's great πονῶ as
an Experimeatalist. He was not, indeed, the first man whose
“ interrogated Nature ;'’ but he gave to Experiment great
prominenee; and has left us descriptions of many attempta
whioh we may smile at for their rudeness, but which, never·
theless, were themselves in the right directior, and led men
onwards. And we must not underrate this excellenee, for, as
I said before, Experiment is really, as mueh as one thing mn
be, the oause os the marked success and progress os the
physieal seienees in modern times.

To sum up; Baeon's Induetion is good, as it oppones tho
ancient and scholastie systems; aa it introduced regularity oi
registration of results; as it tooh wider riews of the relation·
ship between the branehes ol seienee; as it discriminated
between the orders os generalization; as it arranged those
orders; as it based itself upon dissertion and interrogationes
Nature by means os Experiment. His Method failed, however,
in its not aeknowledging the need of a ‘⁴ Mental Initiative,”
and of that sagacity which distinguishes the able man from
the weah; in its cumbrousnoss os Tables, Prerogatires, Reati-
hoations, dre. which (as Coleridge, Friend ll. Essay 8. notieesl
