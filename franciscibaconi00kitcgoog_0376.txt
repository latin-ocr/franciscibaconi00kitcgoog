distinction, in fact, ‘⁶ ars instrumentalis dirigens mentem in
cognitione, (not in eopvvitioncm) rerum.'’ Before considering
this position, it will be as well ιο state, that whatever view we
may talio of Syllogism, as a Method, or even ns an instrument,
we do not for one moment doubt its usefulness as a means of
education3 for it sbnrpens and clears the Intellect, snd gives to
young men greater power of attention, and of sualysis of the
thoughts of otbers3 and so is most litly retained in a system
of educatiom which regards nottho amount of information to
bs acquired so much astho mental power to be brought into
play or improved.

Is theu the Syllogism a sufficient instrument for the guid-
anca of the Human Mind in the discovery os Truth? This is
the question which Bacou asked‚ and answered iu the negative.
lu other words, can man by application of Syllogism ιο his
otherwise unaided reason and semes arrivs unerringly, or even
proximately, at the truth? Does the Method reject error, und
streugthen truth? is it a sels-regulating machine in any de-
gree? For unless it be all this, it must be regarded as insuffi-
cicnt l'or the purposes we have in view. lt is, indeed, a clear
analysis of certain “ Laws of Tliought‚” of certain functions ol*
the mind of Man, and no one ought to wisb ιο take from Ari-
stotle the credit due to him for bis acuteness in detecting the
processes of ressoning; although opinions may differ as lo his
manner of treating his subject, his obscure mothod of illustra-
tion, and his division of the application of Syllogism ιο “ De-
monstratis& and “ Contingent” (or ‘⁴ Topical”) Matter.

· Thefiyllogistic process is based upon one Axiom only, and
that Axium upon the relations between Wholo and Part. (For
we pass by all distinctions between Predication of Iahesioa or
of Eateruiom and regard the matter, as it should be taken,
absolutely.) “ Whatever can ιο predicated of a Whole can be
predicaled of all parts included under that Whole3 whatever
cannot be predicated of the Whole cannot be predicated of the
parts.” Let us allow this to ιο as simple as itlooks; let us
allow too that it will be directly acknowledged as a prime law,
holding in Logic as in everythiug olsc. What then remeius
lor us to dol ιο apply the rule to things. We may indeed
