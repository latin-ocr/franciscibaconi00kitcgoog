cling to technicel languagc, and arriwe at certain symboliesl
results; just as in Algebrs, having got one expmonof
Equnlity, we go on till we obtain another. But when this is
reached we are no nearer our end, unless we go on to fit things
to our symbols. The Dictum de Omni et Nullo is perfectly
futile, unless that Omne and Nullum give place to actual
things. And the application of the syllogistic prooess will he

tions, whst they may) and tvyirg to discover fresh relations

provide us with our knowledge of these things; nor does it

together in certain ways certain results must follow, certain
connectionsbe discovered. It does not profess to touch upon
the most important branch of human knowledge, the gethering
of conceptione from things‚· it does not profess to connect
those conceptione, (or to provide us with principles) it does not
even give us a means of testing the truth of our judgrnents
It demands two already formed judgments, and from them it
deduces a third3 one which is already involved in the fore-
going two; and which contains nothing really new.

But Physics demand more than this. They require a Me·

the growth and clearness of our conceptione; they must be
tended regularly and from the beginning: this the Aristotelian

Legio was utterly unable to do; and consequently no tmth was
ever obtained through its instrumentality. Useful it is for
arrangement3 and as a secondary method in the growth of

scienees3 but placed where it is placed by Aristode, it must
fail. Had it failed and been thrown asido, or applied, as De·
duction is now being applied in modern sciences, no evil would
have resulted; but it obtained such holds on men’s minds that

Such a reformer, in an age when thought was just frecing
itself from the trammels of centuries, was Bacon. We must
pardon his excessive anger against Aristotle, and his uritur-
ness towards him, when we remember what interests were at
