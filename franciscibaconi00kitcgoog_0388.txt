our knowledge of Bacon's system. Thence we lcarn (ι) The
futility of Ancient logic, its “ mera palpatio,” its groping with-
out light to guide it; (2) The necessity of a “ Litorate Expe-
riencc,”-or of the systematic committal to paper of all facts
and results which may come under notice; (3) The ascent in
gencrahzation from particulare, through intermediate Axioms,
to the highest truths, “ per scalam veram ct per gradus oon-
tinuos.’'

(1.) Of the first of these heeds, we need only stay to give
Bacon due praise for the wisc boldness with which he attached
the Ancient Procese. There was clearly nothing to be hopcd
for in Physica (or in any other branch of science) so long aa tho
old Scholastic distinctions and cramped views were dominant.
And we cannot too much admire the bravery which could face
a world in arms; however much we may regret the strange
jealousy which refused to consider those as friends who were
doing so much for Experimental Philosophy, and whose minds
had intuitiwely grcsped the same thoughts, end followed tho
camelinae of discovery which he was himself proposing for
men's consideration and adoption.

(2.) Tor the &periendo Mterato, the consequence of the
spread of learning, and of printing, we may observo that
Bacon himself gives us an example of it in his Tables on
Ηοοι, and in his “ Vindemiatio Prima,” 11. ιι, 12, 13, 18, and
ιο. It was the putting results on record, for the good of
posterity. ’

(3.) Now we come to the chief principle of the Mothcd-thc
successive steps.

The question which first meets us herc is, How do we obtain
any of these steps? Is it by the Simple Enumeration oon-
demned above? or by selection of cases affirmativelyl or by
rejection of negativesl

As to this, Bacon provides us with no thoroughly definite
answer. It is hard to see how the first Table (ll.11.) of
‘⁶ Instantiae convenientes in natura calidi” is other than a sim-
ple enumeration, so far as it goes. Bocon provides ns with
no real rules for selection; nor does he seem to have been
struck by the hopelessness of attempting ιο catalogue so in-
