And ιιι another plaee Aristotle oonfirma thia principle of ample
enumeration by saying‚ ὅτι παν οὕτως ᾧ μηδὲν ἄλλαις-ἱ. e.“ rui
nihil oeeurrit in eontrarium? hnal. Post. ΙΙ. vii. 1

This rs the Aneient induction: a Syllogism ιιι the Third
Figura with a necessary condition attached, whieh, strictly
speaking, takes it out ol the domain of Legio altogether.

This is very different from the Scholastie Induetion which
Aldrieh or that which Abp. Whately have tried to explain.
Aldrieh'a Induetion is“ Syllogiamua eujus Minor retinetur-
a sort of Enthyrneme: and the Minor is the assumption by the
mind that the cases before us may stand for all easea He
thus throws Induetion into Barbara and reducta it to precise
Logieal language. Ι presumo that the meaning of hia method
os analysis is simply this—that haring gathered eertein iu·
straneas, we observa that a oertain quality ia attached to eaoh
of them—‘⁶ Hie et iste et ille magnae trahit ferrum”—and then
we assume that till the contrary is proved in any inatanee, thia
quality may be believed to he present in all casea3 ie. “Omnis
magnes est hie et iate et ille: Ergo; omnia magnes trahit ferrum.'’

Thia is then, praetieally‚ a somewhat altered way of regard-
ing Aneient Induetion: hut is still really “per enumerationem

simplicem” of all known casea.
hbp. Whately holda that Induetion isa Syllogiam in Bar·
