Augmentis Sdentinrum”—“ Axioms or profitable observatione
as fall not within the compass 01 any of the. special parts of
Philosophy or Sciences, but are more common and 0111 higher
stage.’' These Axioms he there collecte together, and regards
as a basis for a “ Prima Philosophia” But 101· all the concerns
01 human lise, the intermediatc Axioms are looked 011 by him
as the valuable ones. We might illustrate from Optios, taking
such propositions as “the diffirsion 01 light from a luminous
body takes place equally in every direction'’—or “ rays 01 light
are capable 01 both Reflection and Refraotioa” These would
be the lowest class 01 Axioms When, by consideration 01 cases,
we had concluded that these Laws are true, then such “Axioms”
as the following might be started as a lower class of “ Media?-
that “ the diffusior 01 light follows a fixed law.” Then that·
that law is, that “ the Intonsity 01 light varies inversely as the ’
suriacc illuminated”-or that the surfaoe illuminated varies as
the distance 'from the luminous body. Or, to take the other
low 11110111, we might pass on to shew, by Induction, that “the
angle 01 lncidence=the angle 01 Reflection'’—or‚ that ‘⁴ Retrac-
tion tahes place at a lixed angle differing according 10 the suh-
stancc through which the ray posses ;'' and so on.

In all these it is quite clear that Bacon means by Axiom no-
thing more than any general principle of the lowest degree 01
generality. And in this he is followed by Sir Isaac Newton‚
who gives the title 01 Axiom to all “general experimental
Truths’'—to the “Laws 01 Motion‚” which are purely induc·
tive, and notat all “ sels-evident” truths-to the principles 01
Optics‚ &c ,

Whereas, let it be remembered‚ modern writers strictly
limit the Term 10 1111 “Laws 01 Resemblance” true 01011 phe·
nomena alike; independent of Causati0n; and so differing
from such a principle as that given above, “ that the angle 01
lncidence=the angle 01 110110011011,” inasmuoh as this latteris
only true 01 certain special phenomena

How the Induction, which ascends by platforms 01 “ 1111101110,η
stories one ovcr another in regular order, can be the same
with that specimen 01 “the discovery 01 Form” given in Bk. 11.
