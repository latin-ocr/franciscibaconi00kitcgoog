reliratiom: the Modern makes no such professione, bnt ap
pesls to the facts of Nature as they are. Finslly,(andtl1is
will be seen to be the most important difference,) the Aneient
was quite content with Obsco-erotica, and seemod to have little
or no notion os ceperimml inquiry: the Modern uses liepe
rimant continnally to carry on and enlsrge the result reached
by Obesi-oetion. 'l'o these heads we may snbjoin Bseon’s state-
ments3 which might bo elassed under them, but which, for dis-
tinetness' sake, had better be kept separatez— Ancient ln
duction prooeeded by “simple enumeration” ot* all known
cases: Modern is content with a selection of Instsncoe: the
Aneient leapt immediately from the lowest perticulam to the
highest principles: the Modern ascende ‘⁴ gradatim,” “per scs·
lam ascensoriam,’' through intermediate Axioms to the highest
truth.

Before discnssing these points more at length, it will be well
to state the distinction, obvious enough in itself, yet ot'ten orer·
loolred, between a process ol the mind, and the‘Aaolysir ol
that process. Aristotle, with the precisiou of his Logieal
power, lms regarded the latter, hoth in his treatises on Dia-
lect-ics and eretorie, and in his sta-tements on Induction: end
he it is wlro has given riso to the remark that ‘⁶ Ancient Logic
is an analysis of our powers and prooesses ol thought, while
the Modern Logio is an applicationes those powers to tlningsJ'
This will at once leod us to the consideration os the first os the
points of differente. “ Tho Anciont Induction was formal 3¹¹
i. e. Aristotle analyscs the process, and lays it down, that itis
syllogistie in form. Lotus turn te his statements on the suh
