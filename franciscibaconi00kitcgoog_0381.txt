850 APPENDIX C.

Bacon's opinions to the simplcr and pleasanter task of anner-
ing those whose superstitious reverence has been hurt at tbc
boldness of this great Prophet of Nature. Let them hear what
he says himself of his Faith3 aud they will not sce much to
lind fault with. And 1 am sure there will be none, unless per·

who will refuso to accept the evidence from his own mouth,
which 1 nm glad to be able to lay before thena

The passages to which I refer are not many; but they arc
weighty. They are Nov. Org. 1. 893 the first part of the Adv.
of learning, under the title of “ Divine Proofs ;” the ossays on
Atheism and Superstition; and lastly‚ a passage which Ivill
transcribe at length, as the Prcface to the great Instauration
from which it is taken, is not likely to be in every ona's

The first two passages (which are very similar), via that
from tho Nov. Org. and that from the Adv. of learning, draw
the distinction between the Revelatiou of God's Will, i. e. Holy
Writ; and the Revelution of Ilis Power, i.e. Nature-and Bacon
is most eareful to declare that natural Philosophy “ merito re-
ligioni donatur tanquam fidissima aneilla ;’' so setting Religion
in the higher place. The connection between the two, and the
fact that as the “Book of Nature ” is God's work, it must have
tendenoies and objects that are good, are fully worked out in
Bp. Butler’s writings. He seems to have caught much of that
spirit which Bacon's works honestly studied will infuse. Tho
chief object of the observations on Religion in connection with
Physics in the Nov. Org. is negative; i. e. to do away with
fcars, lest the two should provo opponents; an object about
which, if he really had a materialist end in view, he¹ would
scarcely have troubled himself.

lf we look at the essays on Atheism and Superstition, we
shall lind in tho former a rebuke to those who are desirons 'of
reducing the human mind to a materialist standard, and that too
couched in no doubtful language. ln the latter we see Bacon's
objection to that ill-grounded fait-h, which is but a form of un-
belief, and which is represented by such writers as le Maistre.
