obliges a materialist ricw of morals: unless indeed one se ex·
pand the term Matter as to break down all distinctions of fact:
for the man who tells me that digestion and thought are alikc
in kind; the former a process of the stomach‚ the latter of the
brain; tells me what he cannot prove, and what lam not
bound to accept. When-ever we discern a fact ve may register
it and think upon it: and there are facts of intellectual or
moral appreciation as well as of physical sensation. And he
who says that because those are all facts, they are all material,
either defines his terms badly, or assumes what he has no right
to ossuum, and dictata in the presumption of ignorance.

With regard to Bacon's admiration for Democritus and the
Athsist Philosophy of the Ancients: we must remember what
that Philosophy stood over agaimt ; and we shall immediately
diesem that Bacon's liking for it arose, not from its Atheism,
but from its inductiva and searching character. And more,
Bacon is himself careful to distinguish between Nature (i. e.
external Nature) and the thinking powers of man. (See Nor.
Org. II. a. “Licet in Natura nihil vere existat praeter corporo
individua—in massae tamen,'’ dre.) So that wc are bound to
believe that his respect for Democritus was limited by the
bonnds of extemal Nature.

Lastly, as respecta his rievvs on linnl Causes3 he particu-
larly refers, in his judgment on them, to the discovery of
Physical truths; and not at all to moral subjecte, as may be
seen by reference to his remarks on Causas in the Advencc·
ment of learning. He foresarv the very use of his objection to
them, that has been made, and guarda against it. lneffeotually,
it appears For men who are interested in making out his
character as an unbcliever, do not fairly put side by side his
different statements on the same subject; but prefer to use
such only as seem to make for their dens. nutis any one will
honestly let Bacon herc, as elsewhere, speok for himself, he will
aequit him of any desire to injure the truths of Christianity‚ by
his disregard of Final Causas. This point 1 have also treated
of at some length in tho notes upon the text, ll. 2, to which 1
