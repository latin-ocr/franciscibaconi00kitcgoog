APPENDIX D. 353

λογίσασθαι-4. Δεῖ δὲ νοεῖν τὸ Γ τὸ ἐξ ἁπάντων τῶν κοθέ-
κοστα συγκείμενον· ἡγὰρ ἐπαγωγὴ διὸ πάντων. 5. Ἔστι δὲ ὁ
τοιοῦτον συλλογισμὸς τῆς πρώτης καὶ ἀμέσου προπόσεως. 6. Ὧν
μὲν γάρ ἐστι μέσον, διὰ τοῦ μέσου ὀσνλλογισμός· poi μή ἐστι,
δι’ έπογυγῆυ. 7. Καὶ τρόπον τινὸ ἀντίκειται ἡ ἐπαγωγὴ τῷ συλ-
λογισμῷ· ὁ μὲν γὸρ διὸ τοῦ μέσον τὸ ἄκρον τῷ τρίτῳ δείκνυσιν· ἡ
δέ διὰ τοῦ τρίπον τὸ ἄκρον τῷ μέσῳ.

Ihave transcribed the passage at length; lor it includes all
the important points ot' Aneient Induction. First, we have
the statement of the Sylloyiam ἐξ ἐπαγωγῆς, where Aristotle
seems to ἀτοπ a distinction between the process of gaining
knowledge and the formal arrangement of that knowledge.
Then he goes on to do away with such distinction by adding
οὕτω γὰρ ποιούμεθα τὰς ἐπογυγάςε and he lays it down that
Induction ie proving the connection between “ Middle'' and
“ Major” by means of the “ Minor :’' i. e. if an ordinary Syllo-
gism runs thus,

' An s a u,
All C is B;
All C is A:
then Induction will run thus—-
All C is A,

AllCisB;
:annisa

Now any person ordinarily acquainted with logical forms will
see immediately that this is logically incorrect3 that, in fact,
it involves an ‘⁴ Illicit process of the Minor.” Therefore it is
that Aristotle adds Δεῖ δὲ νοεῖν τὸ Γτὸ έξ ἁπάντων συγκείμενον,
in other words, the principle of Simple Enumeration (ἡ γὰρ
έπογογὴ on odmen) is introduced, and the whole validity of
ibe processis based upon the assumptiones the ‘⁶ convertibility
ol the Minor,” or, in English, upon the assumption that it is
pomible to exhalat and catalogue all cases on any subject: the
τρίτον, or Μίυον in the Deductive Syllogism, (which is used as
the Midou Term in the induetive,) is really this enumeration
ef all possible cases. Το explain3 let us take Aristotle’s own
illustration.
