Tnn word Form is unfortunately one of the most ambiguous
Terms in the English language. For without rechoning its
applications in ordinary lif03 its censes osa form to sit on, i. e.
a board3 alorm in a school, i. e. they who sit on the board;
form cf a limh, ie. its shape or figure; form of words, i. e.
fixed and anchanging language; form of application (a mo·
difieation of the lnst); form in castiug‚ i. e. the mould; and
1 dare say there are many others; there are also several
applicationis ol the Term in philosophieal language which ron-
der it extremely difficult to speak clearly concerning it. One
source ol confusion we may get rid of direetly. Form, physi-
cally speaking, is the outwrrd, the visible development ol any
substance3 metaphorically speaking, it is just the contrary3 it
iswhat one does not see3 it is the cause ol the external deve-
lopment; it is the thing of which outward figure is the result;
perhaps only the sign. This is but a rongh distinction, and
will require further modification. In the language ol the
schoah, Form is the Natura naturane, the Nature which pro-
duces, which causes substantes to differ one from another;
which is the agent by whose means kinds and classes are dis-
tinguished from each other: wheresore torma are sometimes
called “differentias serm? lt was this vagae conception of
the inner Nature which Bacon seiaed on, and has made sc pro-
minent in the Novum Organon. Althcugh his language is by
uo means clear, his ‘¹ Form'’ ol a Nature is something far
beyond what we now mean by a ‘¹ Law of Nature.” lt meant
the hidden life (a one may so speah) ol each claas3 its “lons
emaustionis‚” from which it tlows3 which else always greum
with the growth3 and decreases with the decresse ol the Na·
ture, whatever that Nature may be. (Nor. Org. ll. 1, 4, 13,
15.) At the same time it is not tc be lorgotten, that Bacon
also cxpressly states that he regards “ Fcrm” as the same thing
with “ lawr* “ Nos autem, quae de formis loquimur, nil aliud

intelligimus, quam leges illas et determinationes actus pnriss',
