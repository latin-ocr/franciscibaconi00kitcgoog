xiv INTRODUCTION.

it for approbation before it went out into the world lthns
pleasod God that it should be otherwise. Instead of it, lhave
but the melancholy ocutus-ion of expressing my gratitudo lor
the hindness‚ and my sorrow at the sudden removal of the late
Deau of Christ Church.

My thanks are due to many friends who have ¹¹⁰le mc,
aud shown an interest in the work which has been my comps
nion, my amusement, and often my solaco, during the lut
year3 and l am especially under obligations to the Rev. Τ. V.
Baync, Μ.Α., Student of Christ Church, lor the valuablc assint·
ance which he gave me with much patience and expense of
time, during the revision of the translation. My thanlis arc
also due to my friend and pupil, R. Southey, Esq„ whose ooun
sel was of the greatest service to me iu the composition of such
of the notes as refer to Physical Scienees.

It only remains lor me to commend this volume to tho
public, with the hope that the study ol Bucon’s writings vill

afford them the same pleasure and profit which it hns given
me.
