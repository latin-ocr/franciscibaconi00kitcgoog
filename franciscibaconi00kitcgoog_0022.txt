INTRODUCTION. xiii

in the Library os Useful Knowledge, which, though scarcely
correct in its divisione os the work, aa, is still worthy of being
consulted. But no student should neglect Dugald Stewart's
Philosophy of the Human Mind. No philosophieal writer has
ever studied Baoon with greater profit: he was among the first

who raised the minds cf men, and led them to look into Baoon’s
vritings, and to judge for themselves, and to profit from them.
They whose turn of mind leads thom that way, will find
that Sir Ι. Newton’s writings are those clamen who was well
acquainted with the mind and phraseology ol' Baeon. Nor
may 'we omit Bp. Butler’s Sermone—a grand application of

explain and illustrate¹ the meaning of the Aethon, and to
point out some of the lines cf thought which he suggests3
and this I have done speciully with a view to those branches of
education which are chiefly followed at Oxford. nom Ger-
man metaphysicians I have taken nothing; partly because I
am but scantily acquainted with them; but still more because it
does not seem to me that their mind and way of thought hove
anything really in common with Bacon's. And 1 trust that
wherever error may be notieed, allowance will be made3 for
a first attempt at illustrating so varied and so prolound an
Author must be both defective aud liable to mistakea It isa
matter ol astonishment to me that no extensive collection of
notes should have hitherto been made on the Novum Orga
non, or indeed on any part of Baoon's writings. Let me hope
that, having made the attempt, l may therehy induce others
to go on with it.

This edition was undertaken principally at tho request, and
with the advice of one to whom l had hoped to have submitted
