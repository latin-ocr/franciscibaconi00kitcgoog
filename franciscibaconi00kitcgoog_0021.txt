xii INTRODUCTION.

scarcely detain any one very long. lt is an illustration brietly ,
given of the first steps of the process as Bacon proposed it: '
and ifthesc Aphorisms did not eontain some statements as te
the usage of the term Form, they would scarcely deserte any
recommendation-for the subject of Heat is of course far
better treated in such works as Turner’s Chemistry, ereren
in Herschel’s Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy.

The hirst Book is almost entirely preparatory. From Aph
1-37 we have some general introductcry statements; from
Aph. 38-92 we are employed cn the clearance of hindrances3
nph. 93-115 give ns the “grounds of Hope;” and Aph.
116-130 are employed in answering objections and doubts
which might be urged against the new Method. Then in
Book ll. 1-10 we have a very brief account of the ends pro
posed; the discovery of Latent Proceee, Latent semaa,
and finally, (the crown of all) of Form.

The student will do well first to read all this rapidly‚ and in
the English3 so as te obtain a general conception ef Bacon's

style of thinking and of his object: then he may take the
Latin Text, (for no translation can do justice tait, or stand in
its stead); and read it carefully and thoughtfully. Baeon’s
language‚ like the secret things of Nature, will not unfold all
its treesures to the hasty passer-by: he who will learn his full

meaning and worth must first sojourn with him and beconm
his friend.

Iknow no better commentary on the Novum Organon than
Sir J. Herschel's Discourse. lt provides frequent illustration
and example3 but, above all, it contains a fair and clear expo
sitien of that modern method of interrogating Nature, which
has its origin in Bacon’s writings3 though the growth of Na·
tural Philosophy has led men tn abendon the pursuit of that
method which Bacen recommended to notice. In Playfnir’s
Dissertation in the Encycl. Brit. (Preliminary Velnme) will be
found an analysis of the work, with many valuable observa
tiens. There is also an account cf the Nor. Org. published
