joiees over him, and elaims him as a friend and a brother.
The former may he sad, the latter-is t'esrful. The {ms
easily eonfuwd hyan appeal to fact, and to Baoou's orn
earnest and wiso langnsgez the latter, as we have secu, tria
to hinder us from using Baeon as a witness against it; or, as
we would rather say, as a witness for himself.

Every fair mind must allow that the horden of prees rests
with the Positivists. Baeon’s langrmge must be proved te be
the same with theirs3 t'or the position he held, and the times
he lived in, allow ol no a priori presumption that his views oo·
ineided with theirs. It is true that the materialist theory of
the Universa was in existence: modern forms ot* error are
usually modificatione of ancient sorms3 and our modern ma
rialists are the Atomists of the Ancienm with the modifioahons
introduced hy the modern Inductive System os investigation:
but in Bacon’s days it was notan aeknowledged riew, and un
less he cau be shewn te have held language such as declares
his mind to have been materialist, the Positiviste have uo right
whatever to claim him as theirs. Το most persons those few
passages from his writings which I shall presently refer to will
be, Ι think, quite conclusive against this; for they shewa
werm as well as an exact Faith: but it will be as well to in·
vestigate briefly the grounds on which he has been claimed os
a Materialist.

First, then, his stat-emente as to an Inductive method t'or the
discovery of facts in man's Moral Nature are alleged, as
shewing that he took a materialist view of the fonctions of the
moral life of man, as though he held that feelings are nervous
sensations, dre. Then hc speaks most savourably of Democri·
tus, and shews great partiality towards the Atheistic Philo-
sephy ol the Ancients. Then he speaks of a ‘⁴ commune vin-

culum animi et corporis,'’ as though mind and body were alike
in kind, alike material. He also regards l‘inal Causea with
little favour.

Does this not seem a narrow foundation for such a structure,
even granting the monstrous position that we may allow that
Bacon's lunguage one way is honest, and the other way not?

An Inductive treatment of moral pheuomena in no way
