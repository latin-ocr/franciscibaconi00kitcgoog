‹lence ol' Liglrtis equal to the angle ol Reflection”—an optieal
“ Principle” on which much depende. The Definitions of Geo
metry may be termed its ‘⁸ Principia? 1f then wo take Axion
in thia senae, we have the authority ol' Bacon and of Sir Isaac

Newton on our sido; against aa we shall lind Dugald Stewart's
Philoa of the Human blind, part ΙΙ. clrap. i. b ι, 2. also Loclse.

xxiv. ξ 7. These all nearly agree in holding that Axioms arc
only those direct and perfectly simple Inductive Truths which,
Ι when onee stated, are felt (by the structure of the mind corn·
. bined with experieuco, as some aay3 by the “nillil eontrarium?
as others hold) to be seli-eadent
Into tho question ol' their procl depending partly on tbe cou-
stitution of the Human mind, or of their entire derivatico from
tho outer world (the point at usuc between Mill and Whewell),
Ι need not enter. And as this noto is intended to explain
Bacon’s use ol this term. we may now pass on to find instances
in which hc tarlres ⁶· Axioma'’ as equivalent to “ Principle ;'’ as
any thing above particulare, cren in the lowest degree—any
general statement, ewen of tho lowest amount ol generality.
The chief place lor the use of the Term in the Novum Orga
non is I.103-105‚ where Bacon treats ol' the discovery oi
Axiorns by means ol the new methodos lnduetion. There we
find him speaking os “Axiomata minora'' or “intima’' which do
not differ very much froin hare experieuce. There is in them
a little more eonseiousnesa oi a law or general statement than
there would be about haro expericnee. whose conclusions
would be exactly the sarire, probably, but not got at so defi·
nitely. Thon thero arc “ Axiornata media”—holding an inter-
mediate rank in generality between the above-mentioned low-
est Axioma the immediate results ol bare experionce‚ and the
highest Axioms, or most general principles in any Art or
Scieneo the “generalissima” ol Bacon. and these last. too,
must be distinguished from the abstract and conceptional
Axioms of the then prcvailing systema. oi Scionoes. And these
“ generalissima* will include these hrioms noticed in tlre ‘⁴ Dc
