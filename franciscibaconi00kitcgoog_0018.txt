INTRODUCTION. ix

shetchiug aa it was intended ιο do, across the whole domain
cf knowledge, Baeon was fain to confess, lay beyond his skill
and power; and he left it ιο posterity to be filled up. Itis as
though his ‘⁴ Instauratio Magua’' gradually eularged ita bor·
ders, and from begirm'mg as a bools ended aa knowledge iteelf.
It is, indeed, doubtful whether he believed that thie part would
ever take the form of a book at all.

Thus then it appears how small a portion os the great
scheme is filled up: andos that small portion filled up, what
a little piecc is that which the Novum Organon coversl

But in the history of the world's growth it holds a promi-

defended; but it has ceased to occupy the minda ol men.
Francis Bacon lives‘m a Philosopher‚ not as a courtier, in the
imperishable memorials οἱ his genius. And yet he was not the
first man who advocated or who practised an experimental
method; nor are his thoughts always original, or always just.
His glory is that he seized the truths which were beginning ιο
emerge from the darkness of thc days that were paat3 that
he adorned them with a genius 'and a poetry which remind
us of the beanties of Plato; that he boldly attacked systema

the authority of centuries aud the opinion of millions; that he
was peculiarly gifted to see the connectione of different sciences
one with another; that he recognised the relationship in which
the human mind stands towards the outer world3 that he had
almost a prophetie foresight; and, finally, that he loved Na-
ture, ae “ the handmaid ol Religion,'’ and had a consistent
and unchanging aim before him-tho appeal ιο facts aa they
are in the world rather than to theories or speculatione, aud
the belief that Nature will not mislend those who go to her
