approximate, according tn modern ways of thought, to Becon’s
conception ο1 Torm.

This may be tried in two weys3 either by looking et the
distinctions he drews between the different kinds ol Form, (ΙΙ.
17, 26.) or by regnrding the relntionship in which, in his Method,
Form stands to Latent Procnen and Latent Semctore.

(1.) We lind two divisions of Ferme. hirst, in ΙΙ. 17. we
hove true Forms distinguished from copulate, sud from Plo-
tonic5 for, Becon snys, “ we must take heed lest, in speaking
of Forms‚ we should be thought tc relcr to those which beve
hitherto occupied men’s thoughts.'’

Oopolcnc Forms he defines ns “ naturarum simplicium con-
jugia ex cursu communi universi.'’ These seem to bc results
produced by ‘⁶ crossing breeds,’' by transgressing neture’s
limits; grafting en epple on a penr stock would perhaps be wbnt
is meent These he promises to consider together with Latent
Prooese end Sooccore. The Platonic Forms he slso rejects;
ond this distinction is importent. Without entering ot nll
into discussion es to what Plnto really intended by his ἰδέαι,
which would be beside our purpose, itis enough to sbew what
conception Becon hed ο1 them. He cells them ideoe obewoctoe,
sud not limited by matter: i. e. the εἴδη χωριστά, es Aristotle
termed thern. (ci. De Augur. Scient IV. iv.) Bncon’s Fom,
then, olwnys resides in the muter ol' each kind; end when (ns
in 1. 23.) he spenlss of “ divione mentis ideae,'' be does not meon
to involve any notion ο1 Archetypnl Forms emnnsting from the
Divine Mind; but only to affirm that God (“ Formstum inditos
et opifex,'' ΙΙ. 15.) is the muse ο1, sud knows the rcsl ond
very nabore of things, ns they ere. lt remnins, then, thet
Form in Becon's lnugnege meone the very nnd inmost nature
ol' things: neither the “ Low ol' Nature’' tc which things ure
obedient, nor the ‘⁶ Archetypnl Forms,'’ being the seme thing:
the former is below, the lnttcr beyond Bncon's conception.

There is still the other division left. This is lound II. 26;
where he is describing ‘¹ Constitutive or collective Instences.’'
For these he apologizes3 they ere low, ‘⁴ postulet res ct infir-
mitos hnmani intellectus, ntsormoe particulares notentur.”
